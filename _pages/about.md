I am a PhD in the Alpha research group at the Computer Science Department of the University of Turin. I have obtained my Bachelor 's degree in Computer Engineering in 2020 and my Master's degree in Data Science for management in 2021, both at the University of Catania. Besides that, I practice streetlifting, basketball, football, chess, and I love reading books and going disco.
