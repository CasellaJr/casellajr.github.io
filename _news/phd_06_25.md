Exciting news! I have finally completed my PhD in Modeling and Data Science with a thesis titled "Advancing Federated Learning - Towards Decentralization and Personalized Models".
I thank my supervisor, Prof. Marco Aldinucci, for all the support during these 3 years and a half years, my research group, and my PhD thesis reviewers and committee, Prof. Michael Kamp and Prof. Sebastian Buschjaeger.
